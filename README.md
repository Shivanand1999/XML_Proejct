# XML_Proejct
I developed this Java Project when I was learning Java. Now-a-days since the amount of work of software developers/engineers/testers is increasing, the need of automatically detect the differences between two xml files with minimum time has been increased . This Java XML Comparator Project accepts two xml files as input:- source.xml - The reference file from which target file will be compared target.xml - The target file which will be compared with reference file These XML files will be parsed, and all the nodes will be retrieved by diffferent methods using DOM Parser and will be compared. The compared results are displayed in pdf document which will contain all the missing or additional attributes/nodes/tags of the target file. This project is designed and implemented to minimize the manual efforts of differentiating two xml files of same structure. It will be very useful when we want to compare two large xml files of same structure.
